# Reflect-Anki-Sync

## Project Description

This project is designed to generate an Anki importable text file from a Reflect.app CSV dump. Reflect.app is a note-taking application that provides end-to-end encryption for user data, ensuring privacy and security.

## Usage

1. Export your notes from Reflect.app as a CSV file.
2. Run the script provided in this repository to convert the CSV file into an Anki importable text file.
3. Import the generated text file into Anki to create your flashcards.

## Limitations

Due to the end-to-end encryption implemented by Reflect.app, it is not possible to build a more automated solution for accessing and processing the data. The current Reflect.app API does not support direct information access, which is why manual export and conversion are necessary.
